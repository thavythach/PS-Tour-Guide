===================
[3-4-5] Point A to point B to point c 
===================
-Load screen -> map of ups campus (birds eye view)
# birds eye view? okay what about satellite view? also preference can be set in settings somewhere instead of just setting a forced one on the user 
# possibly a prompt for first time use
-map zoom -> specific landmarks selected for more information
# markers are for sure to be a feature
-locations/directions can be searched on Google Maps
# google maps api will surely be used, however, other APIs will be on research queue
-top left button -> menu links to other pages [core of navigation]
# not a bad idea, but a swiping left for a full menu of links is much better 
# great aesthetic idea - android has a lot of features that we don't know about so this is good!

-load screen -> map of ups campus with a menu
-menu -> locations 
# menu by swipe on the left is possible 
# menu also in the middle of the map
1 setting -> open a sidebar containing a list of sites/buildings on the campus 
	list -> link containing the LatLng object information and could link to a pin at the location on the map 
	# great great stuff, but.... possibly keep all of the lat and lng in a database. and grabbing all of that data by querying would be BEST case scenario. we can filter as we want as well - very efficient.

-load screen -> 6 items
	maps, 
		1 view -> full screen interactive map # yes
		2 settings -> red dot and home # yes, possibly instead of "home" a logo
		1 setting -> get directions # yes, but needs discussion
			get direction, 
				2 inputs -> start, finish # discussion needed
				1 view -> small map # i liked this, but of course we need discussion
	meals, (on click -> full screen)
		4 settings -> sub menu, cellar menu, opp menu, div menu # great idea
		2 settings -> red dot and home # yes, possibly instead of "home" a logo
	study, 
		4 settings -> offers, ask, refine, shows own posts to see replies 
			offers,
				inputs -> location, subject, etc. # offers/ask discussion is needed, but overall great concept
				2 settings -> refine, shows own post to see replies # discussion
			live feed,
				on click of individual post ->  two views # i love this concept
					one view -> reply # yas
					one view -> read # yas
				2 setings -> refine, shows own post to see replies # discussion
		1 view -> live feed of offers/asks for all subjects # yas # discussion
	events, (nearby)
		3 tabs (day, week, month) # discussion and optimizations can be extended
		2 settings -> red dot and home # yes, possible instead of "home" a logo
	red dot, (automated by using name + location)
		2 settings -> call now and file report button using email # email im not sure is possible # but love the idea
		2 settings -> red dot and home
		CONSTANT -> on every screen # dig it
	settings, (on click -> full screen)
		4 settings -> visual, red dot, personal, app info # refinement and discussion
		2 settings -> red dot and home 
		CONSTANT -> on every screen # possible logo instead of a "home"
# freaken stellar design and effort 
# first screen is gucci, but possible design should be discussed/mapped again b/c we have to keep the user in mind in how they use it.

#overall review
# great start - skeleton seems pretty good to know where we want to start
# Implementing maps with a bunch of puget sound campus latitudes will be ideal first
# implementing a loading screen with a map and a logo will be good as well. 

===================
[6] Orientation 
===================
- portrait or both

- start with portrait

[9] what exactly are we trying to do?
===================
- improve the experience of students at UPS using 21st century technology
# 21st century technology is pushing it LOL, we aren't even halfway there yet haha

# yas basically

- open UPS campus to visitors while simulanteously making information about the local community more accessible to students, hopefully creating a more integrated environment in terms of school-and-town interaction
# yas good job
- providng potential new students with greater information than is alreay available (such as pictures of dorm rooms, for example, may encourage a higher enrollment rate and improve the prospects of UPS in the future)
